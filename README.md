# Decade Sports Trivia

## Objective
Decade Sports Trivia is a trivia game that tests your knowledge of American prfoessional sports through the last 50 years. The game starts with a random question regarding one of the four major professional US Sports (NHL, NBA, MLB, NFL). From there, a question is given from another major sport until all four have been covered. Once this occurs, a question from the 1980's decade is given from one of the same sports. This continues through the 2010s decade. For each question that is answer correctly, the user receives one point. 

### Solution
The object is to get the maximum 20 questions correct to earn 20 points.

## Major Hurdles

I encountered several hurdles while making this app. They included:

- I wanted to have the user get at least 2 questions right per decade before moving on to the next, but I couldn't work out the logic
- Another hurdle was allowing the "Play Again?" button to stand by itself without a random question appearing by it once the game ends
- Prepaing the hue for each correct/wrong answer was also a minor hurdle

## User Stories

- I want the user to answer the 20 questions to the best of their ability
- I want the game to notify the user when they get an answer right or wrong with both the changing of colors on the page and the score
- I want the user to finish with 20 points if they answer all questions correctly
